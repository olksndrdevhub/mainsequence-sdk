    "Main Sequence Assets are closely aligned with the Open FIGI asset master list available at https://www.openfigi.com/. Each asset on the Main Sequence platform shares identical properties with its corresponding asset listed in Open FIGI. The primary difference on the Main Sequence platform is that each asset also includes a unique identifier determined by the execution venue.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that an execution venue is not always synonymous with an exchange. The execution venue refers to the entity or platform where the account holding the asset is maintained. For example, Interactive Brokers could be an execution venue. This means that within an Interactive Brokers account, one might hold NVDA shares listed on a specific exchange with a FIGI from https://www.openfigi.com/search?marketSector=All&searchTerms=NVDA. However, this holding must be differentiated from NVDA holdings maintained in an account at another execution venue, such as Alpaca. Although the FIGIs remain the same, the unique identifiers differ. On the Main Sequence platform, the unique identifier combines the asset ticker, FIGI, and the execution venue symbol.\n",
